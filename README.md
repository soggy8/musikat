# 🎵 Music Downloader - For Navidrome and local downloads

> **⚠️ Announcement (March 2025):** Spotify is changing their API requirements. **Apps using Development Mode will stop working after March 9, 2026** unless the app owner has an active Spotify Premium subscription. Migration to a free metadata source (e.g. MusicBrainz) is planned. See [Spotify's migration guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/february-2026-migration-guide) for details.

A modern web application that allows users to search for songs on Spotify and automatically download them from YouTube, then seamlessly add them to your Navidrome music server. Perfect for building your personal music library with proper metadata, album art, and organized file structure.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS

- **Spotify API**: For searching and getting track metadata
- **yt-dlp**: For downloading audio from YouTube
- **mutagen**: For ID3 tagging
- **Navidrome**: Music server integration

## Prerequisites

**For Docker (Recommended):**
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Spotify API credentials ([Get them here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard))

**For Manual Installation:**
- Python 3.8+ (Python 3.11 recommended, avoid 3.13 due to compatibility issues)
- FFmpeg (required by yt-dlp for audio conversion)
- Spotify API credentials ([Get them here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard))
- Navidrome server (optional, for direct server uploads)

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended - Easiest!)

**Just 3 steps:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/soggy8/music-downloader.git
cd music-downloader

# 2. Setup environment (add your Spotify credentials)
cp backend/env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env and add your SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET

# 3. Run it!
docker-compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser. Done! 🎉

> **Note:** If you want to use Navidrome, edit `docker-compose.yml` to mount your Navidrome music directory. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for details.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd musicDownloader
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install FFmpeg

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Windows:**
Download from [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to PATH

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
# Spotify API Configuration
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/callback

# Navidrome Configuration
NAVIDROME_MUSIC_PATH=/path/to/navidrome/music
NAVIDROME_API_URL=http://localhost:4533
NAVIDROME_USERNAME=admin
NAVIDROME_PASSWORD=password

# Download Configuration
OUTPUT_FORMAT=mp3
AUDIO_QUALITY=128

# API Configuration
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

### 5. Get Spotify API Credentials

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
4. Add `http://localhost:8000/callback` to Redirect URIs (optional for client credentials flow)

### 6. Configure Navidrome Path

Set `NAVIDROME_MUSIC_PATH` to the directory where Navidrome stores its music library. This path must be:
- Writable by the user running the backend
- Accessible (local filesystem, NFS mount, or similar)

## Running the Application

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

Or with uvicorn directly:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The application (both frontend and API) will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

The frontend is automatically served from the backend, so no separate frontend server is needed.

## Usage

1. Open the web interface in your browser (http://localhost:8000)
2. Choose download location: "My Downloads Folder" or "Navidrome Server"
3. Search for a song, artist, or album
4. Browse the search results
5. Click "Download" on any track you want
6. Watch the progress in the download queue at the top
7. Downloads complete automatically:
   - **Local downloads**: Files are saved to your browser's Downloads folder
   - **Navidrome uploads**: Files are added to your Navidrome library (Artist/Album structure)

## How It Works

1. **Search**: Uses Spotify API to search for tracks and get rich metadata
2. **Download**: Uses yt-dlp to search YouTube and download audio
3. **Tagging**: Applies ID3 tags using metadata from Spotify (title, artist, album, cover art)
4. **Upload**: Copies the file to Navidrome's music directory in organized folders (Artist/Album/)
5. **Scan**: Optionally triggers Navidrome to scan for new files (if API credentials are configured)

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/search` - Search for tracks on Spotify
  - Body: `{ "query": "search term", "limit": 20 }`
  
- `GET /api/track/{track_id}` - Get details for a specific track

- `POST /api/download` - Start downloading a track
  - Body: `{ "track_id": "spotify_track_id", "location": "local" | "navidrome" }`

- `GET /api/download/status/{track_id}` - Get download status

- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

## Troubleshooting

### Spotify API Errors

- Make sure your Client ID and Secret are correct
- Check that you've created an app in the Spotify Developer Dashboard

### YouTube Download Fails

- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and in your PATH
- Check your internet connection
- Some videos may be region-locked or unavailable

### YouTube Bot Detection ("Sign in to confirm you're not a bot")

If you see errors like "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot", YouTube is blocking automated requests. You can bypass this by using YouTube cookies:

1. **Export cookies from your browser:**
   - Install a browser extension like "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" (Chrome/Firefox)
   - Visit youtube.com and log in
   - Export cookies in Netscape format to a file (e.g., `youtube_cookies.txt`)

2. **For Docker:**
   - Mount the cookies file in `docker-compose.yml`:
     ```yaml
     volumes:
       - /path/to/youtube_cookies.txt:/app/youtube_cookies.txt:ro
     ```
   - Set environment variable:
     ```yaml
     environment:
       - YOUTUBE_COOKIES_PATH=/app/youtube_cookies.txt
     ```

3. **For manual installation:**
   - Add to `backend/.env`:
     ```env
     YOUTUBE_COOKIES_PATH=/path/to/youtube_cookies.txt
     ```

**Alternative:** Use yt-dlp to export cookies:
```bash
yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser chrome --cookies youtube_cookies.txt "https://www.youtube.com"
```

**Note:** Cookies expire periodically. Re-export them if downloads start failing again.

### Navidrome Upload Fails

- Verify `NAVIDROME_MUSIC_PATH` is correct and writable
- Check file permissions on the Navidrome music directory
- Ensure the path exists

### CORS Errors

- Update `CORS_ORIGINS` in `.env` to include your frontend URL
- Make sure the frontend is accessing the correct API URL
